Welcome to the HELPR Documentation
==================================================

Hydrogen Extremely Low Probability of Rupture (HELPR) is a modular probabilistic fracture mechanics platform developed to assess structural integrity of natural gas infrastructure for transmission and distribution of hydrogen natural gas blends. HELPR contains fatigue and fracture engineering models allowing fast computations, while its probabilistic framework enables exploration and characterization of the sensitivity of predicted outcomes to uncertainties of the pipeline structure and operation.
